# 🌐 My Frontend Portfolio Collection 🚀

Welcome to my **Basic Frontend Portfolios** repository! 🎨✨  
A curated collection of web projects built *exclusively* with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Live Demos

Each project comes with its own live demo link in its respective README file.  
Feel free to explore each project individually and see the magic in action! ✨

## 🌟 Overview  

This repository showcases my core frontend skills, emphasizing **clean code**, **modern design principles**, and **responsive layouts**. It features various small to medium-sized projects, such as landing pages, interactive components, and mini-apps—all powered by pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### What I demonstrate here:
- 🎯 Semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility and clarity
- 📱 Responsive design using CSS Flexbox & Grid
- ⚙️ DOM manipulation & basic application logic with vanilla JavaScript

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **HTML5** | Structuring content with semantic tags |
| **CSS3**  | Styling, layout, animations |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Adding interactivity and dynamic features |

> **Note:** While I may utilize utility classes or resets like Normalize.css, the focus remains on raw, pure implementation.
